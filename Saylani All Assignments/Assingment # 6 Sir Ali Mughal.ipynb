    "Class: In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state and implementations of behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object: In object-oriented programming (OOP), objects are the things you think about first in designing a program and they are also the units of code that are eventually derived from the process. Each object is an instance of a particular class or subclass with the class's own methods or procedures and data variables.\n",

    "Attribute: In Object-oriented programming (OOP), classes and objects have attributes. Attributes are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance. One can think of attributes as noun or adjective, while methods are the verb of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior: A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will \"react\" if asked to do something by another class or object or if its internal state changes. Behavior is the only way objects can do anything to themselves or have anything done to them.\n"
